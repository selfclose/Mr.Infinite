**My startup redbean**

Use autoload (PSR-0) and [Redbean](http://www.redbeanphp.com/) for ORM

It's not fully MVC, but it can make things easier, because We do same thing all the time.

I'm serious about file size, so I avoid large ORM or framework that's have a bunch of unused code.

* In 'include.php' there is config.
* Each file will tell how it's work.
* Example model (src/RB/Model) that's extends from Controller.

**Ability**
* CRUD make more simple through model
* ReadAll
* Count
* Paginate (php / jQuery with ajax)
